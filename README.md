## IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate

Today I am beginning my coursework on the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course through Coursera and IBM. I applied for and was accepted to this course in July. <br>

This readme file will attempt to document my progress, thoughts, notes and overall impressions of the course as I go along. It has been recommended that I spend 10 or so hours per week on the course starting now and ending in mid November. That's more than three solid months of learning about data science and I am looking forward to it. My ultimate goal is to become TensorFlow certified on or near August 01, 2024, which is 357 days from now. <br>

With that in mind, I'm back to the program. It's just after 9:00 p.m. on August 09, 2023. <br>
