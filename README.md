## IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate

Today I am beginning my coursework on the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate course through Coursera and IBM. I applied for and was accepted to this course in July. <br>

This readme file will attempt to document my progress, thoughts, notes and overall impressions of the course as I go along. It has been recommended that I spend 10 or so hours per week on the course starting now and ending in mid November. That's more than three solid months of learning about data science and I am looking forward to it. My ultimate goal is to become TensorFlow certified on or near August 01, 2024, which is 357 days from now. <br>

With that in mind, I'm back to the program. It's just after 9:00 p.m. on August 09, 2023. <br>

I've just completed the first of two sections of the course that are due by August 20th. It was mostly an overview of the data ecosystem and what people do with data. The presentation of the material was easy to understand and bite-sized in scope. So far, so good. <br>
